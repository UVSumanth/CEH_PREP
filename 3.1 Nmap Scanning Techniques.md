## 📡 Overview of Nmap Scanning

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is one of the most powerful tools used during the **Scanning Phase** of ethical hacking. It helps identify:

- Live hosts
- Open/closed/filtered ports
- Running services
- Operating system fingerprints
- Presence of firewalls

## 📘 1. TCP Connect Scan (`nmap -sT`)

### 🔹 Description:
- Also known as **Full Open Scan**
- Uses the **complete TCP 3-way handshake**
- If a connection is successful, the port is marked as **open**

### 📶 How TCP 3-Way Handshake Works:
1. **SYN** – Client initiates a connection to server
2. **SYN-ACK** – Server acknowledges and responds
3. **ACK** – Client acknowledges the response

> This scan is easily detectable in logs because it establishes a full connection.

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- Does **not require admin/root privileges**
- Easier to detect by IDS/IPS
- Use when SYN scan is not allowed (due to firewall or permission)

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ 2. Stealth Scan / SYN Scan (`nmap -sS`)

### 🔹 Description:
- Also called a **Half-Open Scan**
- Only completes the **first two steps** of the handshake
- Default scan in **Nmap (requires root/admin privileges)**

### 🚦 How It Works:
1. Sends **SYN** packet
2. If **SYN-ACK** is received → Port is **Open**
3. If **RST** is received → Port is **Closed**
4. If no response or ICMP unreachable → **Filtered**

### 🧪 Command Examples:
- `nmap -sS <target>`
- `sudo hping3 -S <target> -p <port>` → Similar SYN scan

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- More stealthy than TCP connect scan
- Not logged by many systems
- Requires elevated privileges
- Efficient and fast — commonly used in real-world pentesting

## 🚫 3. Inverse TCP Scans

These scans send **unexpected or malformed flags** to determine the port state based on **RFC-compliant behavior**.

### 🔻 FIN Scan (`nmap -sF`)
- Sends a **FIN** packet without an active connection
- **Open ports**: No response
- **Closed ports**: Respond with **RST**

### 🔻 NULL Scan (`nmap -sN`)
- Sends a packet with **no flags** set
- Open ports → No response  
- Closed ports → RST returned

### 🔻 XMAS Scan (`nmap -sX`)
- Sends packet with **FIN, URG, and PSH flags** set (lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄)
- Open ports → No response  
- Closed ports → RST

### 🔻 Maimon Scan (`nmap -sM`)
- Used to bypass packet filters and firewalls
- Uses FIN/ACK combination
- Behavior depends on the target OS

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- **Open ports** do **not** respond (per TCP RFC)
- **Closed ports** send **RST**
- Works well against **non-Windows systems**
- May be blocked or ineffective on some modern firewalls

## ⚙️ 4. ACK Scan (`nmap -sA`)

### 🔹 Description:
- Sends **ACK** packets instead of SYN
- Simulates an ongoing connection (middle of communication)
- Used to **detect firewalls or packet filters**

### 🔍 Behavior:
- **No RST** response → Packet likely **filtered** (stateful firewall)
- **RST** response → Port is **unfiltered** (no stateful inspection)

### 🔎 How to Analyze:
- Helps identify if a firewall is **stateless** or **stateful**
- TTL (Time to Live) values can also help:
  - **TTL < 64** = likely **open**
  - **TTL ≥ 64** = likely **closed or filtered**

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- Doesn’t determine open/closed port directly
- Used for **firewall detection**
- Doesn't generate as many logs as SYN/Connect scans
- Best used in combination with other scans

| SYN (Stealth)     | `-sS`     | Half-open handshake                  | Quiet & quick open port scan      | Yes (root/admin)    |
| FIN               | `-sF`     | Sends FIN packet                     | Detects open/closed without connect | Yes              |
| NULL              | `-sN`     | No flags set                         | RFC-compliant port detection      | Yes                 |
| XMAS              | `-sX`     | FIN + URG + PSH flags                | Rare, stealthy scan               | Yes                 |
| Maimon            | `-sM`     | FIN/ACK combo                        | Bypass filters, OS dependent      | Yes                 |
