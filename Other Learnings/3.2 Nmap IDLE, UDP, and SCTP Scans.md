## 🔍 1. IDLE/IPID Scan (nmap -sI) – Zombie Scan

### 🧠 What is it?
An advanced stealth scan that uses a third-party "zombie" host to perform the scan indirectly. The attacker hides their IP by spoofing the zombie’s IP.

### 📚 How It Works:
1. Attacker sends SYN-ACK to Zombie → Zombie replies with RST.
2. Attacker checks the IPID value from the Zombie's RST packet.
3. Attacker sends a SYN to the Target, spoofing the Zombie’s IP.
4. Target replies to Zombie:
   - If port is **open**, target sends SYN-ACK → Zombie replies with RST → IPID **increases**
   - If port is **closed**, target sends RST → No change in IPID
5. Attacker checks Zombie's IPID again to infer port status.

### Command:
```bash
nmap -Pn -p <port> -sI <ZombieIP> <TargetIP> --packet-trace
```

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- Stealth scan – avoids detection and hides the attacker's identity
- Requires an idle host with predictable IPID sequence
- Can bypass firewalls and logging systems

## 📶 2. UDP Scan (nmap -sU)

### 🧠 What is it?
Used to scan for open **UDP services**, which are connectionless (unlike TCP). Important for discovering services like DNS, SNMP, TFTP, etc.

### 🔍 How It Works:
- Sends a UDP packet to a target port:
  - **No response** = Port is likely open or filtered
  - **ICMP Port Unreachable** = Port is closed
  - **ICMP Type 3 Code 1/2/3/9/10/13** = Port is filtered

### Command:
```bash
nmap -sU <target>
```

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- No 3-way handshake – UDP is connectionless
- Requires admin/root privileges
- Common with ports like 53 (DNS), 161 (SNMP), 69 (TFTP)
- Very slow – prone to timeouts and retries

## ⚙️ 3. SCTP INIT Scan (nmap -sY) and COOKIE ECHO Scan (nmap -sZ)

### 🧠 What is SCTP?
**Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)** is a transport layer protocol used in telecom, VoIP, and signaling networks. It uses a **4-step handshake**.

### 🔹 SCTP Handshake Process:
1. Host1 → INIT → Host2
2. Host2 → INIT-ACK → Host1
3. Host1 → COOKIE ECHO → Host2
4. Host2 → COOKIE-ACK → Host1

---

### 🔸 SCTP INIT Scan (nmap -sY)

### How It Works:
- Sends an INIT chunk to a target SCTP port
- **INIT-ACK** = Port is open
- **ABORT** = Port is closed

### Command:
```bash
nmap -sY <target>
```

---

### 🔸 SCTP COOKIE ECHO Scan (nmap -sZ)

### How It Works:
- Sends COOKIE ECHO (step 3 of the handshake)
- Responses can indicate whether the port is accepting connections

### Command:
```bash
nmap -sZ <target>
```

---

### 📌 CEH Key Points:
- Use when working with telecom or VoIP infrastructure
- Requires root privileges
- INIT-ACK = Open, ABORT = Closed
- Less common, but included in CEH syllabus

| Scan Type        | Nmap Flag | Purpose                          | Response Behavior                         | Privileges |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| IDLE/IPID        | -sI       | Stealth port scan using Zombie   | Inferred via Zombie IPID changes          | Yes        |
| UDP Scan         | -sU       | Scan for UDP services            | No response = open; ICMP unreachable = closed | Yes    |
| SCTP INIT        | -sY       | Discover open SCTP ports         | INIT-ACK = open; ABORT = closed           | Yes        |
| COOKIE ECHO      | -sZ       | SCTP scan (3rd handshake step)   | Analyzes COOKIE-ACK behavior              | Yes        |

✅ **CEH Exam Tips**:
- IDLE scans rely on IPID sequence – stealthy, no direct contact
- UDP scans are slow and rely on ICMP responses
- SCTP is a niche topic but appears in CEH – learn INIT and COOKIE ECHO behavior
- Know which scans require root access and how responses determine port states
