# üåë Understanding the Dark Web & Darknet ‚Äì Educational Reference

## üìò What is the Dark Web?

The **Dark Web** refers to a hidden portion of the internet that is **not indexed by traditional search engines** and requires special tools like **Tor** to access.

It exists within **overlay networks** ‚Äî networks built on top of the regular internet ‚Äî known as the **Darknet**.

## üß† Dark Web vs. Darknet

| Term       | Meaning | Explanation |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Darknet** | A type of **network** | An overlay network requiring specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. Not publicly accessible. |
| **Dark Web** | A part of the **Darknet** | The actual websites and services (e.g., `.onion` sites) hosted on darknets like Tor. |

> üîÅ **Analogy**:  
> - **Darknet** = Hidden Roads  
> - **Dark Web** = Secret Buildings on those roads

## üï∏Ô∏è Layers of the Internet

| Layer           | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Surface Web** | Public websites (Google, YouTube, Wikipedia) |
| **Deep Web**    | Private, unindexed content (banking portals, academic records) |
| **Dark Web**    | Hidden services requiring special tools (Tor, I2P) to access |
| **Darknet**     | The encrypted network infrastructure behind the Dark Web |

## üí° Original Purpose of the Dark Web

The Dark Web was originally **developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab** in the mid-1990s using **Tor**.

### üîç Purpose of Tor (The Onion Router)

- Provide **anonymous online communication**
- Help **journalists, whistleblowers, and activists** operate safely
- Protect against **censorship and surveillance**

> ‚úÖ It was designed with **ethical and privacy-focused goals**, not for illegal purposes.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How Does the Dark Web Hide Your Identity?

### üîê Tor (The Onion Router)

Tor anonymizes users by encrypting their traffic and routing it through **three relays** in the Tor network:

1. **Entry Node** ‚Äì Knows your IP but not where you're going
2. **Middle Node** ‚Äì Just relays traffic
3. **Exit Node** ‚Äì Connects to the final destination, but doesn't know who you are

> üîÅ **Flow**:  
> You ‚Üí Entry Node ‚Üí Middle Node ‚Üí Exit Node ‚Üí Destination

Each "layer" is peeled away like an onion, giving **Tor its name**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è How the Dark Web is Exploited

Though its roots are ethical, the Dark Web today hosts **both legitimate and illegal activity**.

### ‚ùå Common Illicit Use Cases

- Black markets (drugs, weapons, fake documents)
- Data leaks (stolen passwords, credit cards)
- Ransomware forums and malware sales
- Zero-day exploit markets
- Hiring cybercriminals or hitmen (often scams)
- Child exploitation (highly illegal and tracked by law enforcement)

### ‚úÖ Ethical Use Cases

- Hosting for journalists in oppressive countries
- Anonymous forums for political dissent
- SecureDrop: Platforms for whistleblowing
- Uncensored knowledge distribution

| **SecureDrop & Anonymous Blogs** | Learn how secure whistleblowing works |

---

## üîß Tools to Explore (Safely & Ethically)

| Tool/Service     | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Tor Browser**  | Anonymous access to .onion sites |
| **Ahmia.fi**     | Search engine for Tor domains |
| **OnionScan**    | Scanner for vulnerabilities in dark web services |
| **Maltego / SpiderFoot** | OSINT tools with dark web plugins |
| **Shodan (Surface)** | Often used alongside to trace visible exposed assets |
| **Dark Web Monitoring Services** | Cyble, Recorded Future, etc. for threat intel |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never engage in illegal activity or unauthorized access. Use these tools only for **educational or lawful professional purposes**.

## üîé Examples of Darknets (Not Just Tor)

| Darknet | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tor**     | Most popular, uses .onion domains |
| **I2P**     | Invisible Internet Project, supports anonymous hosting |
| **Freenet** | Peer-to-peer network focused on censorship resistance |
| **ZeroNet** | Decentralized web using Bitcoin cryptography |

---

### üß© What is a `.onion` URL?

- A special-use top-level domain only accessible through the **Tor network**
- Not resolvable by regular DNS or browsers

### üßæ What is PGP?

- **Pretty Good Privacy** encryption used to verify identities or encrypt messages in dark web transactions and communications

### üö´ Is It Legal to Access the Dark Web?

| Activity                     | Legality |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Accessing `.onion` sites     | ‚úÖ Legal in most countries |
| Reading public dark web content | ‚úÖ Legal |
| Buying/selling illegal items | ‚ùå Illegal |
| Attempting unauthorized access | ‚ùå Illegal |
| Participating in forums promoting illegal activity | ‚ùå Illegal |
