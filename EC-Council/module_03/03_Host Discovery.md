## üîç Host Discovery Overview
Host discovery is the initial step in scanning to identify which hosts are alive and active on a network. It helps attackers build a target list before launching port scans or vulnerability assessments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scanning Techniques

### 1. ARP Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Identify live devices on a local IPv4 network.
- **How:** Sends ARP requests; devices reply with MAC addresses.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PR`, `-sn` to disable port scan.
- **Bypasses firewalls** since it works at Layer 2.

---

### 2. UDP Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Check if host is online without using TCP/ICMP.
- **How:** Sends UDP packets to default or custom ports.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PU`, Zenmap.
- **Benefit:** Works when TCP and ICMP are filtered.

---

### 3. ICMP Echo Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Traditional ping method using Echo Request/Reply.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PE`
- **Limitation:** Often blocked by firewalls or disabled in Windows for broadcasts.

---

### 4. ICMP Echo Ping Sweep
- **Purpose:** Sweep entire subnet for live hosts.
- **Tool:** `fping`, `nmap -PE` with range.
- **Limitation:** Slow, often blocked, no broadcast support on Windows.

---

### 5. ICMP Timestamp Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Request system time to detect host presence.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PP`
- **Use Case:** Useful if Echo is blocked; helps detect OS behavior.

---

### 6. ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Requests subnet mask to confirm host status.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PM`
- **Note:** Rarely used today; many systems ignore it.

---

### 7. TCP SYN Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Send SYN to port, detect SYN-ACK.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PS<port>`
- **Stealthy:** Doesn't complete 3-way handshake (no logs).

---

### 8. TCP ACK Ping Scan
- **Purpose:** Sends ACK, awaits RST.
- **Tool/Option:** Nmap `-PA<port>`
- **Use Case:** Bypasses firewalls that block SYN.

> ‚úÖ **CEH Tip:** Firewalls often block ICMP Echo but allow other packet types like ACK or UDP. Use alternative ping scans (e.g., ARP, ACK) in stealth environments.
