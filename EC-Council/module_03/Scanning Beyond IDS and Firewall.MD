Scanning Beyond IDS and Firewall
Various IDS/Firewall Evasion Techniques 

Packet Fragmentation
What It Does: Splits probe packets (e.g., SYN/FIN scans) into smaller fragments to bypass firewalls and IDS that inspect complete packets.
How It Works:
- Breaks a TCP header into multiple smaller packets (fragments).
- These fragments are sent one by one to the target.
- IDS/firewalls may ignore or fail to reassemble fragmented packets.
- Target host reassembles fragments into the full packet.
Common tools:
 - Nmap --mtu <size>
 - fragroute
ðŸ“Œ Often used with SYN/FIN scanning to evade detection.
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World (Defender):
 - Helps test IDS/firewall evasion capabilities.
 - Can check how systems handle fragmented traffic (stability, logging).
Attacker Use:
 - Evades detection by signature-based IDS.
 - Helps bypass packet filters that block complete TCP headers.
 - Used to avoid false positives and trigger fewer alerts.

Source Routing
What It Does: Allows the sender of an IP packet to specify the route it takes through the network, rather than letting each router choose the next hop.
How It Works:
- Source routing info is stored in the IP options field of the packet.
- Two types:
 - Strict Source Routing: Packet must follow the exact route specified.
 - Loose Source Routing: Packet must pass through specified routers but can take other hops in between.
- Attackers use this to bypass firewalls or IDS by avoiding filtered paths.
- Rarely used in modern networks due to security risks.
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World (Defender):
 - Used in some network diagnostics or legacy routing setups.
 - Generally disabled due to security concerns.
Attacker Use:
 - Forces packets through unmonitored or vulnerable routes.
 - Helps evade security controls like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
 - Exploits misconfigured routers or legacy devices that still honor source routing.
Note: *** Most modern routers ignore or block source-routed packets.

Source Port Manipulation
What It Does: Fakes the source port of a packet to make it look like itâ€™s coming from a trusted or commonly allowed port (e.g., HTTP or DNS) to bypass firewalls/IDS.
How It Works:
- Firewalls often trust traffic from well-known ports (e.g., 53 for DNS, 80 for HTTP).
- Attackers manipulate the source port of their packets to appear as if coming from these ports.
- Misconfigured firewalls may allow this traffic assuming it's legitimate.
- Tools like Nmap allow this with -g or --source-port option.
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World (Defender):
 - Helps test firewall misconfigurations.
 - Used in penetration testing to simulate evasive attacks.
Attacker Use:
 - Bypasses port-based filtering by spoofing trusted ports.
 - Useful in environments where only traffic from certain ports is allowed.
 - Often targets legacy or poorly configured firewalls.
Note: *** Modern firewalls with deep packet inspection can detect and block this technique.

IP Address Decoy 
What It Does: Hides the real attackerâ€™s IP by mixing it with fake (decoy) IPs â€” making it harder for IDS/firewalls to detect the actual source of the scan.
How It Works:
- Sends scan traffic using multiple IP addresses (real + fake).
- Logs on the target system will show all decoy IPs, not just the attackerâ€™s.
- Tools like Nmap support:
  - Random decoys: nmap -D RND:10 [target]
  - Manual decoys: nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,ME,decoy3 [target]
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World (Defender):
 - Used in red teaming to simulate stealthy attacker behavior.
 - Helps test IDS effectiveness against evasion techniques.
Attacker Use:
 - Evades detection/logging by confusing defenders.
 - Makes it hard to trace the real attacker from logs.
 - Useful during stealth reconnaissance and scanning.
Limitation: If the target uses response path tracing or advanced detection systems, it may still find the real IP. Also, using many decoys can slow down the scan.

IP Address Spoofing
What It Does: Fakes the source IP address of a packet to appear as if itâ€™s coming from a trusted or different host.
How It Works:
- Attacker modifies the packet header to spoof a source IP.
- Target replies to the spoofed IP, not to the attacker.
- Commonly used in DoS attacks where replies flood the spoofed IP or exhaust target resources.
Tool Example: hping3 www.target.com -a 7.7.7.7 (spoofs IP 7.7.7.7)
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World:
 - Used in penetration testing to evaluate how firewalls handle source IP filtering.
Attacker Use:
 - Bypasses IP-based filters and weak IDS/firewall rules.
 - Performs DoS attacks (spoofed IP causes reply flood or timeout).
 - Helps avoid detection by hiding real IP.
Limitation:  Spoofed IP cannot complete TCP 3-way handshake, so itâ€™s mostly used for stateless attacks like DoS.

MAC Address Spoofing
What It Does: Fakes the source MAC address of a device to bypass MAC-based filters on firewalls or switches.
How It Works:
- Attacker uses Nmap or other tools to send packets with a forged MAC.
- Packets appear to originate from a trusted MAC address.
Nmap Examples:
  - Random MAC: nmap -sT -Pn --spoof-mac 0 [target IP]
  - Vendor-specific: nmap -sT -Pn --spoof-mac Apple [target IP]
  - Manual MAC: nmap -sT -Pn --spoof-mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 [target IP]
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World:
 - Test if MAC filters on a network are properly enforced.
Attacker Use:
 - Evades MAC-based filtering on LANs.
 - Avoids detection by spoofing trusted vendor MACs.
 - Useful in wireless attacks or internal recon.
Limitation: MAC spoofing only works within the same network segment (LAN).

Creating Custom Packets
What It Does: Creates manually crafted network packets to bypass firewalls, IDS, or test security systems.
How It Works:
- Attackers use packet crafting tools (e.g., Colasoft Packet Builder, NetScanTools Pro) to customize fields like TCP flags, TTL, ports, etc.
- Can simulate legitimate traffic or send malformed packets that normal scanners donâ€™t generate.
- These packets are then sent to the target at custom intervals, patterns, or in fragmented form.
Why Itâ€™s Used:
Real World (Defender):
 - Used for network testing, firewall auditing, and simulating attacks for assessment.
Attacker Use:
 - Helps evade detection systems (by sending fragmented/malformed/custom traffic).
 - Bypasses firewalls that block known scanning patterns.
 - Can launch DoS attacks or probe vulnerabilities not detectable with regular scans.
Example Tool: Colasoft Packet Builder
- GUI-based tool to build, edit, and send custom packets.
- Provides Decode Editor and Hex Editor for deep customization.
- Allows sending crafted packets in loops or with delay, useful for stealthy attacks.

Proxy Servers & Anonymizers 
What It Does: 
Helps attackers or users:
 - Hide their real IP address
 - Bypass firewalls, IDS/IPS
 - Access restricted or censored content
 - Surf the Internet anonymously
How It Works
- A proxy server receives your request â†’ sends it to the destination server â†’ then forwards the response back to you.
- Logs at the destination show the proxy's IP, not yours.
- Proxy chaining: uses multiple proxies to increase anonymity.
- Anonymizers act like advanced proxies â€” strip identity, encrypt data, and route via other countries/servers.
Why It's Used
Real-World Use
 - Protect internal networks (NAT, firewalls)
 - Content filtering (schools/orgs)
 - Bandwidth control
 - Anonymized research or data scraping
Attacker Use
 - Evade detection
 - Hide true source IP
 - Bypass geo-restrictions or corporate firewalls
 - Conduct scans or attacks anonymously
 - Chain proxies or use VPNs to avoid being traced
Common Tools
Proxy Tools
 - Proxy Switcher: Rotate between proxies
 - CyberGhost VPN: Masks IP, encrypts connection
 - Shadowsocks: Lightweight, secure proxy (good for mobile)
 - Burp Suite: Intercept and modify web traffic (also used in testing)

Anonymizers
 - Tor: Onion routing network for deep anonymity
 - Whonix: VM-based OS routing all traffic through Tor
 - Orbot (Mobile Tor), Psiphon Pro, Tails OS

Proxy vs. Anonymizer
Feature	Proxy	Anonymizer
Use case	Hides IP, controls access	Privacy & censorship bypass
Advanced routing	Manual or single proxy	Networked (Tor/I2P)
Encryption	Optional (HTTPS/SOCKS)	Often encrypted
Risk of trace	Medium	Low (multi-hop routing)
