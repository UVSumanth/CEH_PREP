# CEH Module 06: Information Security Controls

---

## 🛡️ Information Assurance (IA)

**Definition:**  
Information Assurance ensures **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Authenticity** of information and systems throughout **usage, processing, storage, and transmission**.

### 🎯 Core Objectives of IA
- Prevent unauthorized access or alteration of data.
- Maintain business continuity and secure daily operations.
- Ensure **only authorized users** access sensitive information.

---

## 🛠️ Controls Used in Information Assurance

1. **Physical Controls**
   - Security guards, surveillance cameras, locked doors, biometric access, etc.
2. **Technical Controls**
   - Firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption, secure protocols, authentication mechanisms.
3. **Administrative Controls**
   - Policies, security awareness training, incident response procedures.

---

## 🔗 Relationship Between IA and Information Risk Management (IRM)

IA and IRM work together to:
- **Minimize risks**
- **Control access** to information
- **Maintain resilient systems**

---

## 🔄 Key IA Processes

1. **Policy & Guidance Development** - Establish security rules, standards, and baselines.

2. **Network & Authentication Design** - Create secure architectures and robust authentication systems.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Identify, evaluate, and prioritize vulnerabilities in networks/systems.

4. **Problem Identification & Resource Planning** - Detect system flaws, allocate security resources effectively.

5. **Applying IA Controls** - Deploy safeguards aligned to risk severity.

6. **Certification & Accreditation (C&A)** - Ensure security compliance and validate risk mitigation effectiveness.

7. **Training & Awareness** - Promote cybersecurity understanding across all user levels.

## ♻️ Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy

Security today must be **continuous and adaptable** to evolving threats.  
The strategy includes:
- **Protection**
- **Detection**
- **Response**
- **Prediction**

---

## 🧱 Defense-in-Depth Strategy

**Definition:**  
A layered security approach where multiple controls (physical, technical, administrative) protect data and systems.

> If one layer fails, others continue to protect the system.

---

## ⚠️ Understanding Risk

**Definition:**  
Risk is the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, causing harm or loss.

### 🔁 Risk Formula:

> **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**
OR (expanded):
> **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Asset Value**

> **Level of Risk = Consequence × Likelihood**

---

## 📊 Risk Matrix

A tool to scale and visualize risks based on:
- **Probability**
- **Impact severity**
- **Likelihood of occurrence**

---

## 🔐 Risk Management Phases

1. **Risk Identification**  
   - Pinpoint internal/external risks, their sources, and potential consequences.

2. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Estimate likelihood and impact of risks; prioritize responses.

3. **Risk Treatment**  
   - Apply appropriate controls to reduce identified risks.

4. **Risk Tracking**  
   - Monitor implemented controls and detect emerging risks.

5. **Risk Review**  
   - Evaluate strategy effectiveness and adjust as necessary.

## 🕵️ Cyber Threat Intelligence

### 🔍 Types of Threat Intelligence:
- **Strategic** – High-level trends (used by executives).
- **Operational** – Specific attacks or campaigns (used by SOC).
- **Tactical** – TTPs of threat actors.
- **Technical** – IoCs like IPs, hashes, domains.

---

## 📈 Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

1. **Planning and Direction**
2. **Collection**
3. **Processing and Exploitation**
4. **Analysis and Production**
5. **Dissemination and Integration**

---

## ⚙️ Threat Modeling

Used in Secure SDLC to identify threats to an application/system.

### Steps:
1. Identify Security Objectives
2. Application Overview
3. Decompose the Application
4. Identify Threats
5. Identify Vulnerabilities

---

## 🚨 Incident Management

**Definition:**  
Processes designed to **identify, prioritize, and resolve security incidents** to minimize damage and restore operations.

### Includes:
- Vulnerability & artifact analysis
- Intrusion detection
- Awareness training
- Technology monitoring

### Goals:
- Reduce incident impact
- Improve service continuity
- Increase efficiency and user satisfaction

---

## 🛠️ Incident Handling and Response (IH&R)

**Definition:**  
Organized actions taken after detecting a security incident.

### Steps:
1. **Preparation**
2. **Incident Recording and Assignment**
3. **Incident Triage**
4. **Notification**
5. **Containment**
6. **Evidence Gathering and Forensic Analysis**
7. **Eradication and Recovery**
8. **Post-Incident Activities**

---

## 🤖 Role of AI & ML in Cybersecurity

### Benefits:
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Prediction of future threats
- Accelerated threat analysis

**ML:** Learns normal behavior and flags anomalies.  
**AI:** Learns, reasons, and adapts to complex threats.

---

## 💡 AI/ML Use Cases in Cybersecurity

1. **Password Protection & Authentication**
2. **Phishing Detection & Prevention**
3. **Threat Detection**
4. **Vulnerability Management**
5. **Behavioral Analytics**
