NetBIOS Enumeration 
What It Does: NetBIOS Enumeration allows attackers (or ethical hackers) to extract detailed info from Windows systems, such as:
Usernames | Shared folders/printers | Computer and domain names | Services running (like Messenger, Server)
How It Works
- NetBIOS operates using ports 137 (UDP), 138 (UDP), and 139 (TCP)
- Attackers use tools like nbtstat or NetBIOS scanners to:
  - Query name tables
  - Access shares
  - Discover usernames and device roles
Example:
nbtstat -A <IP>  ‚Üí Shows remote system‚Äôs NetBIOS name table
nbtstat -c       ‚Üí Shows local NetBIOS name cache
NetBIOS names are 16-character strings:
- First 15 chars: device name
- 16th char: service code (e.g., <00> for hostname, <20> for server)
Why It's Used
Real-World Use (Ethical Hacker):
- Find accessible shares to assess weak configurations
- Identify network devices and services
- Understand domain setup for security audits
Attacker Use:
- Exploit weakly secured shares (read/write access)
- Launch Null Session attacks
- Run DoS attacks or collect usernames for brute-force attacks
Tools Used
- nbtstat (built-in Windows command)
- NBTscan, Hyena, SoftPerfect Network Scanner
- Metasploit modules (auxiliary/scanner/netbios/...)

üî¢ Example NetBIOS Codes
Code	Type	Meaning
<00>	Unique	Hostname
<03>	Unique	Messenger service for host or user
<20>	Unique	Server service (used for sharing)
<1B>	Unique	Domain Master Browser (Primary Domain Ctrlr)
<1D>	Group	Master browser for subnet
<1E>	Group	Browser service elections

NetBIOS Enumeration Tools
What It Does: These tools scan networks to gather sensitive NetBIOS-related information such as:
Computer and domain names | Usernames and groups | MAC addresses | NetBIOS shares | Logged-in users
How It Works
- Scans a range of IP addresses to detect systems running NetBIOS
- Uses protocols like SMB to extract system info
- Some tools rely on Windows APIs; others use Nmap NSE scripts to fetch name tables, MACs, shares
Why It‚Äôs Used
Real-World Use (Ethical Hacker):
- Asset inventory and network mapping
- Validate access control settings
- Detect unprotected shares
Attacker Use:
- Gather usernames for brute-force attacks
- Access open/unsecured shares
- Identify weak devices via OS/service enumeration
üõ†Ô∏è Common Tools
Tool	Use
NetBIOS Enumerator	Lists NetBIOS names, MACs, users, domains for IP ranges
Nmap + nbstat.nse	Retrieves NetBIOS names and MAC addresses
Hyena	GUI-based auditing and enumeration of Windows systems
Advanced IP Scanner	Fast IP range scanning with NetBIOS info
Global Network Inventory	Lists OS, shares, services
Nsauditor	Combines enumeration and vulnerability assessment

Example Command : nmap -sV -v --script nbstat.nse <target IP>
Shows:
- NetBIOS name
- Logged-in user
- MAC address
If verbose, shows all related NetBIOS names

Enumerating User Accounts with PsTools
What It Does: Helps gather user, system, and session info from local or remote Windows systems via command-line utilities. It also allows remote command execution, process control, log viewing, and password reset without needing a GUI.
How It Works
- Uses Microsoft‚Äôs Sysinternals PsTools suite
- Connects to remote systems over the network using admin credentials
- Executes commands like:
 - Show logged-in users
 - Kill a process
 - Retrieve user SID
 - Change passwords
 - Shut down or restart remote machines
Why It's Used
Real-World Use (Admins & Pen Testers):
- Perform remote system administration without logging in physically
- Check who‚Äôs logged in, running processes, open files
- Gather system info for auditing
Attacker Use:
- Identify active sessions and user accounts
- Change or reset passwords on compromised systems
- Kill security processes or install backdoors
- Escalate privileges and maintain remote control
Key PsTools & Their Purposes
Tool	What It Does
PsExec	Run commands remotely like Telnet replacement
PsFile	View/close files opened remotely
PsGetSid	Find SID of users/accounts or resolve SID to username
PsKill	Kill processes on local or remote machines
PsInfo	Display system information (CPU, memory, OS)
PsList	Shows CPU/memory/thread stats per process
PsLoggedOn	Shows who is logged in locally/remotely
PsLogList	Dumps event logs for local/remote computers
PsPasswd	Reset/change passwords for user accounts
PsShutdown	Shutdown, reboot, hibernate, or log off remote machines
[Provide a well structured table]
Example Commands
psexec \\192.168.1.10 cmd
psloggedon \\192.168.1.10
pskill \\192.168.1.10 notepad.exe
pspasswd \\192.168.1.10 Administrator NewPass123

Enumerating Shared Resources Using net view
What It Does: net view lists shared folders, printers, and computers on a network. It helps identify available network resources in a workgroup or domain.
How It Works
- net view is a built-in Windows command-line tool
- Connects to a specified computer or domain using SMB (port 139/445)
Displays:
 - Available shares
 - Hidden shares (with /ALL)
 - Other computers in the network or domain
Common Commands:
net view \\<computername>        # Lists shared resources on a specific computer
net view \\<computername> /ALL   # Lists all shares, including hidden ones
net view /domain                 # Lists all domains/workgroups
net view /domain:<domainname>   # Lists computers in the specified domain
Why It's Used
Real-World Use:
- Used by network admins to check what resources are shared in a workgroup/domain
- Helps in auditing shared folders/printers across systems
Attacker Use:
- Attackers use it for reconnaissance
Helps identify:
- Sensitive shared folders (e.g., Admin$, C$)
- Poorly protected file shares
- Systems to target for lateral movement
