## 🎯 Objective
Social engineering is the non-technical art of manipulating people to divulge confidential information. It is often the **initial phase** of an attack, used in **reconnaissance and footprinting**.

---

## 🎭 What is Social Engineering?

- Exploits **human psychology**, not technical flaws.
- Attackers rely on **ignorance, trust, and negligence** of individuals.
- It’s effective because **humans are often the weakest link** in the security chain.

---

## 🎯 Information Gathered by Social Engineers

- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
- Usernames and passwords
- Security software/products in use
- Operating system and version
- Internal IP addresses, server names
- Network layout & topology

## 🛠️ Techniques Used in CEH for Social Engineering

| Technique        | Description                                                                                   | CEH-Relevance                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Eavesdropping** | Unauthorized listening to private conversations, VoIP calls, or messages                     | Helps attacker capture credentials or sensitive business data                  |
| **Shoulder Surfing** | Observing someone’s screen or keyboard to extract PINs or passwords                          | Often used at ATMs, cafes, airports                                           |
| **Dumpster Diving** | Retrieving sensitive information from trash (e.g., bills, notes, printed docs)              | Might uncover network configs, credentials, or insider data                   |
| **Impersonation**  | Pretending to be someone else (e.g., IT staff, delivery guy) to extract confidential info   | Used in phone-based or in-person attacks to bypass security questioning       |

## 📌 Example Scenarios (CEH Context)

1. **Pretending to be IT support** to ask employees for login credentials to "resolve" an issue.
2. **Phishing emails** designed to look like internal communication asking for account verification.
3. **Dumpster diving outside office buildings** to collect bills, password notes, and discarded access cards.

## 🧠 CEH Exam Tips

- Understand **each type** of social engineering attack and its **contextual application**.
- Know the **difference** between technical footprinting and **non-technical methods like impersonation**.
- Be familiar with how **human errors** are exploited during the reconnaissance phase.
