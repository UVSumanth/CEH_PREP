A. Terminate a connection  
B. Confirm data receipt  
C. Initiate a connection  
D. Restart the communication  

‚úÖ Correct Answer: C. Initiate a connection

___

A. SYN ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí RST  
B. FIN ‚Üí FIN ‚Üí SYN  
C. RST ‚Üí ACK  
D. FIN ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí FIN ‚Üí ACK

### Network Scanning Tools
**Q1.** You are performing a stealth port scan using hping3 to avoid detection by IDS. Which type of scan is best suited for this purpose?  
A. UDP Scan  
B. TCP Connect Scan  
C. SYN Scan  
D. ACK Scan    

Answer: ‚úÖ C. SYN Scan    
Reason: SYN scan is half-open and does not complete the TCP handshake, making it stealthy.

**Q2.** Which of the following hping3 commands is used to check if a host is online by sending ICMP echo requests?  
A. hping3 -8 <Target IP>  
B. hping3 -A <Target IP>  
C. hping3 -1 <Target IP>  
D. hping3 -2 <Target IP>  

Answer: ‚úÖ C. hping3 -1 <Target IP>  
Reason: -1 switch sends ICMP echo requests, similar to ping.

**Q3.** A CEH professional wants to gather the Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of a target host to prepare for a TCP session hijacking attack. Which command should they use?  
A. hping3 -8 <Target IP> -S  
B. hping3 <Target IP> -Q -p 139  
C. hping3 -F -P -U <Target IP>  
D. hping3 -S <Target IP> -p 22 --flood  

Answer: ‚úÖ B. hping3 <Target IP> -Q -p 139  
Reason: The -Q flag tells hping3 to collect ISNs, useful in hijacking.

**Q4.** Which hping3 command would you use to simulate a TCP SYN flood DoS attack on port 22 of a target?  
A. hping3 -A -p 22 --flood  
B. hping3 -S <target> -p 22 --flood  
C. hping3 -2 <target> -p 22  
D. hping3 -9 http -I eth0  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B

---

**Q5.** Which result from a UDP scan indicates a closed port on the target system?  
A. No reply from the target  
B. ICMP Port Unreachable message received  
C. RST packet received  
D. SYN-ACK response  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B

---

**Q6**. What is the primary benefit of using a SYN scan over a full TCP connect scan in a penetration test?  
A. Higher packet payload  
B. Guaranteed port enumeration  
C. Lower chance of detection by security systems  
D. Better for scanning mobile networks  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: C

---

**Q7.** What information can be obtained using the hping3 -Q -p 139 <target> command?  
A. Firewall rules  
B. HTTP traffic  
C. Initial Sequence Number (ISN)  
D. UDP service banner  
‚úÖ Correct Answer: C
